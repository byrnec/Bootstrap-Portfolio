# Bootstrap-Portfolio

Homework 2 part 1

## Getting Started
The purpose of this assignment was to remake our original portfolio assignment (I used the template provided), and to substitute in Bootstrap components to that portfolio anywhere we need a grid, in order to have a responsive layout. I also inserted a navigation bar from Bootstrap.

### Steps:
Using Bootstrap, I recreated my portfolio site with the following items: 

*A navbar

*A responsive layout 

    *eg. On xs and sm screens, content should take up the entire screen. On md and larger screens, you should have some margins on the left and right side of the screen. Check out various sites on your mobile device versus your computer to see this in action!

*Responsive images
